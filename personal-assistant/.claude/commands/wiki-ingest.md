  Process a single source into the memory/ wiki and TASKS.md. Accepts a generic input
  (file path, URL, pasted text, or an MCP reference), loads relevant context, proposes a
  scope of candidate points for {{NAME}} to select via AskQuestion, then writes only the
  approved entries into the right pages.

## Goal
Process a source into the [**memory**](../../memory/CLAUDE.md) layer and [**TASKS.md**](../../TASKS.md).

The input is **generic**: it can be a file path, a URL, raw text pasted directly into the chat, or a reference to content reachable via an MCP server (e.g. a meeting transcript, a chat thread, an issue tracker item, a shared doc). An input is **mandatory** — the command does nothing without one.

## Workflow

Follow these steps strictly and in order. Use `TodoWrite` to track progress through each step.

### Step 1: Acquire the input

The input arrives as `$ARGUMENTS`. **If it is empty**, prompt {{NAME}} for a source (text, URL, file path, or MCP reference) and **stop**. Otherwise, go to Step 2.

### Step 2: Load context

Starting from the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md), follow the Deep-Dive Navigation table recursively into the sub-areas relevant to the source. Read the most likely affected pages so you avoid duplication and contradiction.

### Step 3: Propose ingest scope and align with {{NAME}}

Before touching any pages, surface what's worth ingesting and let {{NAME}} pick exactly what to keep. **This avoids spending tokens on details that don't deserve to be remembered, and avoids landing content in the wrong layer.**

Present the candidate points directly through the `AskQuestion` tool as a single multi-select question (`allow_multiple: true`), so {{NAME}} just selects which entries to ingest. Order the options by significance (most significant first), and make each option label self-contained, with each part on its own line: a significance tag (**[strongly worth ingesting]**, **[worth a brief mention]**, or **[probably not worth ingesting]**) and short title, the destination file(s), and a one-line summary of the substance. For example:

```
[strongly worth ingesting] Continuous-discovery cadence
[`memory/concepts/continuous-discovery.md`]
adopt biweekly customer interviews
```

**If a candidate point's destination is ambiguous** (e.g. could land as either a work-area update *or* a concept-page update), say so in the option label and name the better fit.

Ingest exactly the selected entries in Step 4. If {{NAME}} has already indicated relevant points in the command invocation, still present the full set of candidate options — the prompt is a hint, not a final scope.

### Step 4: Execute the approved scope

Apply each approved write directly. For each target page: read it first to understand current content and placement, then add/update/move the content at the right spot (after which heading, before which section, at the end of which list).

Follow these rules on every write:

1. All markdown links must be standard markdown: `[label](relative/path.md#anchor)`. Never use `[[wikilinks]]`.
2. References to external-tracker items must be clickable links to their source URL, never bare IDs.
3. No authorship timestamps in memory pages: no `first_seen`, `last_updated`, no `Update YYYY-MM-DD:` markers. Keep dates that are real-world events.
4. Don't add or modify frontmatter timestamps. Keep existing `type` and `name` fields.
5. Match the existing writing style of each file — concise, no filler, bold for key terms.
6. Don't create person pages unless explicitly told to — capture inline first.
7. Don't add new work-area sections in [`TASKS.md`](../../TASKS.md) unless explicitly told to.
8. New memory pages get frontmatter: `type: concept | preference | person | synthesis`, `name`.

### Step 5: Report

Respond verbatim "ingestion successfully finished"
