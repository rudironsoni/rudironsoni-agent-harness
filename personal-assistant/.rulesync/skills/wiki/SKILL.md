# LLM Wiki

A persistent, compounding knowledge base. The LLM writes and maintains the wiki; {{NAME}} curates sources, directs analysis, and asks questions.

## Architecture

Three layers:

- **Sources** (`sources/`) — raw, immutable input documents (transcripts, articles, PDFs). Never modified by the LLM.
- **Wiki** (`memory/`) — flat directory of LLM-generated markdown pages. All pages are siblings. `memory/AGENTS.md` is the navigation hub.
- **Schema** (`AGENTS.md` + this skill) — governs structure and operations.

## Operations

### Ingest

Process a raw source from `sources/` into wiki pages. Invoked via the `/project:wiki-ingest` command.

**Input:** path to a source file.

**Steps:**

1. Read the source document fully.
2. Identify key information:
   - **Decisions** made and their rationale
   - **Action items** and who owns them
   - **People** mentioned (names, roles, context) — capture on the relevant project/concept page, never as standalone pages
   - **Concepts/themes** discussed
   - **Contradictions** with existing wiki content
3. For each new concept/theme that deserves its own page, create one:
   ```yaml
   ---
   type: concept
   name: Concept Name
   first_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---
   ```
4. Update existing project and concept pages with new information from the source. Add cross-references (`[link text](other-page.md)`) between related pages.
5. Update `memory/AGENTS.md`:
   - Add new pages to the appropriate section (Projects, Concepts, Preferences)
   - Update one-line summaries if they've become stale
6. Delete the source file from `sources/` — it has been fully processed.

**Rules:**
- Never modify files in `sources/`. They are immutable.
- **Never create person pages.** People are documented inline on the project or concept pages where they are relevant (e.g., a collaborators table or section).
- One page per entity (project, concept). If a page already exists, update it — don't create a duplicate.
- Every new page must be added to `memory/AGENTS.md`.
- Delete each source file after processing — `sources/` should be empty when all ingestion is done.
- Use relative links between wiki pages (they're all siblings in `memory/`).
- Frontmatter `type` field is required on all pages: `project`, `concept`, `preference`, or `synthesis`.

### Query

Answer questions using the wiki as the primary knowledge source.

**Steps:**

1. Read `memory/AGENTS.md` to identify relevant pages.
2. Read those pages.
3. Synthesize an answer with citations to specific wiki pages.
4. If the answer represents a valuable synthesis (comparison, analysis, connection), offer to file it as a new wiki page of type `synthesis`.

**Rules:**
- Always cite which wiki pages informed the answer.
- If the wiki doesn't contain enough information, say so and suggest sources to ingest.

### Lint

Health-check the wiki. Run periodically or on request.

**Checks:**

1. **Orphan pages** — files in `memory/` not listed in `memory/AGENTS.md`.
2. **Broken links** — references to pages that don't exist.
3. **Stale content** — pages not updated in 30+ days that reference active projects.
4. **Missing cross-references** — pages that mention entities with their own page but don't link to them.
5. **Contradictions** — claims in one page that conflict with another.
6. **Missing pages** — entities mentioned across multiple pages that lack their own dedicated page.
7. **Index drift** — one-line summaries in `memory/AGENTS.md` that no longer match page content.

**Output:** a report listing issues found and suggested fixes. Apply fixes only with confirmation.
