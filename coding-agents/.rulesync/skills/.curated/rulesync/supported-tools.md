- ✅: Supports project mode
- 🌏: Supports global mode
- 🎮: Supports simulated commands/subagents/skills (Project mode only)
- 🔧: Supports MCP tool config (`enabledTools`/`disabledTools`)
- ⚠️: Deprecated — still supported, but see the note below

## Deprecation notes

- **Gemini CLI (`geminicli`)** — Google is retiring Gemini CLI on **June 18, 2026**, when it stops serving requests for Google AI Pro/Ultra and free Gemini Code Assist for individuals (Enterprise plans are unaffected). The successor is the **Antigravity CLI (`antigravity-cli`)**. `geminicli` is **not** removed from rulesync — Enterprise access continues and existing `GEMINI.md`/`.gemini/` repositories still rely on it — but new projects should prefer `antigravity-cli`. See the [Gemini CLI → Antigravity CLI migration guide](../guide/geminicli-to-antigravity-cli.md).
- **Google Antigravity (`antigravity`)** — Antigravity 2.0 splits into two products: the desktop **`antigravity-ide`** and the **`antigravity-cli`** (`agy`). The legacy `antigravity` target is now a **deprecated alias for `antigravity-ide`** that keeps its original `.agent/` (singular) paths for backward compatibility. Migrate to `antigravity-ide` (desktop IDE) or `antigravity-cli` (CLI). As of Antigravity 2.0 the IDE reads its global MCP config and skills from the shared `~/.gemini/config/` tree — `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` and `~/.gemini/config/skills/`, matching the current [MCP](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp) and [Skills](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills) docs. The `antigravity-cli` global MCP config also lives in the shared `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, while the CLI keeps its own global skills tree at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`. Both targets also intentionally **share** the global rule file `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` and the global hooks file `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` — enabling both targets in `--global` mode writes those shared files once. For project-scope rules, **both `antigravity-ide` and `antigravity-cli`** emit the root rule as a plain cross-tool **`AGENTS.md`** at the project root (the Gemini-lineage discovery order is `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `GEMINI.md`; the IDE has read `AGENTS.md` since v1.20.3) and non-root rules under `.agents/rules/` (the IDE adds trigger frontmatter to non-root rules; the CLI keeps them as plain markdown).
- **Kiro (`kiro`)** — Kiro ships as two products with diverging config formats: the **Kiro IDE** reads Markdown subagents (`.kiro/agents/*.md`) and `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` agent hooks, while the **Kiro CLI** reads JSON agent-config subagents (`.kiro/agents/*.json`) and agent hooks in `.kiro/agents/default.json`. A single target cannot emit both faithfully, so `kiro` is split into **`kiro-cli`** and **`kiro-ide`**. The legacy `kiro` target is kept as a **deprecated alias** (its current mixed output is unchanged for backward compatibility). Shared surfaces (steering rules with `inclusion`, `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, `.kiro/prompts/` commands, `.kiro/skills/`, `.kiroignore`, permissions) are identical between the two; they differ only in **subagents** (`.md` vs `.json`). Kiro IDE **hooks** (`.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook`) require multi-file output that the current single-file hooks pipeline does not yet emit, so `kiro-ide` does not support `hooks` (use `kiro-cli` for agent hooks).
